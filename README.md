# scrycord
Scryfall provides [bots](https://scryfall.com/bots) for Discord and Slack that can retreive cards and print them to your channels. The Scryfall bots, however, only let you search for cards by name, so if you want to do a more advanced query like `t=enchantment ci=g legal=modern` you can use Scrycord for the convenience of not having to pull up the website every time. Scrycord uses the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api).

If you want to use this bot on your Discord server, it's preferable that you host it yourself, which you can do by following Discord's [tutorial](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and creating a file named `token` containing your secret token to run the bot.
