# scrycord
Scryfall provides [bots](https://scryfall.com/bots) for Discord and Slack that can retreive cards and print them to your channels. The Scryfall bots, however, only let you search for cards by name, so if you want to do a more advanced query like `t=enchantment ci=g legal=modern` you can use Scrycord for the convenience of not having to pull up the website every time. Scrycord uses the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api).

If you want to use this bot on your Discord server, it's preferable that you host it yourself, which you can do by following Discord's [tutorial](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and creating a file named `token` with your secret token to run the bot. You can also add it to your server by using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1120705294931075102&permissions=0&scope=bot) if you want to. 

Note that, if you decide to use the link above, the bot might not always be online, and that if your query is especially broad, the bot might not return all cards as the Scryfall API itself will not return all the cards.
